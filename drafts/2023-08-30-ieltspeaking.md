其实口语的话题离不开生活，工作，运动，文化，旅行.

part1和part3来说，是需要回答yes/no，再跟上自己的理由/看法，再加点互动更好。

part2，需要在几个问题下，做一个2min左右的小短文，短文的核心是故事，来支撑自己的观点，比如"我去了甘肃，因为那是丝绸之路的必经之路，我对丝绸之路的历史感兴趣，去了很多博物馆，了解了很多知识文化，对我影响很深，这是一个记忆深刻的旅途." "在小学的时候，我的成绩很差劲，所以周围的人大多都看不起我，但那时候a给了我鼓励，并且帮助我的学习，我得到了很大的进步，他是一个乐于助人，和蔼的朋友" 就要塑造一个原因，一个事件，甚至要描述这个事件的特点，比如地点，时间(long long ago)，人物，事情.

在短时间内塑造一个故事是困难的，如何快速捏造一个故事呢？比如看星空的topic
- **背景**：天空是一个距离我们很遥远的地方，它会令我缓解压力和放松，
- **地点**: 我选择去乡村的一个山脚下去观看，
- **事件**: 我第一次在天上看到了很多星星，
- **感慨**: 那是让人印象深刻的景色，我感觉到人类的渺小，开始思考更加宏大(great,grand)的宇宙,
- **总结**: 这真的是一个难以忘怀和毫不后悔的经历。
