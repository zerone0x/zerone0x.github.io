# 阅读方法

读题 --> key words --> 通过同义词定位 --> 不同题型的应对

- 不要咬文嚼字
- 每个题大概1-2min

# 做题顺序

填空 --> 判断 --> 选择 --> heading

# 时间分配

每篇文章20min左右

# 不同题型的应对

## 填空

夹心饼干

## 判断
两个以上的同义词

### 易错点
- not given 容易选yes/no
  - 很多题是能够推测/猜出的，但最好找到原文相关的段落，没有的话就是not given

## 选择

类似于判断
- 准确定位后，需要理解逻辑关系，防止误选

## heading

### 易错点
- 速度太快，对中心定位不准确（只靠开头结尾），导致中心偏移
  - heading还是尽可能读下中间部分的细节，以防止误选
