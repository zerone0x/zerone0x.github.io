How to be happier?

# enough rest

it includes the body and mental

# simple life

It includes the relationship and life style, even about the consuming habit(buy less)

# do things quickly

less hesitating, more time to enjoy it

# do the meaningful things

It means less labor a day, more lesiure vice versa

# filter the dumbs and garbage

Reading is a worthwhile thing to put time in, not the split time in social media, this is time killer, in some way.

# health

This is most important part of it, if lost health, then you lost most of your life.
The health is hard to keep, one way to keep far from the disease is to overcome the bad habits other than generating a good habit. 
Do sports will make you happy, try it in the outdoors.

# Less relationship

Good relationship needs energy to put into, so don't put the energy to many unimportant ppl. thats not worth it.

# follow the pace you have

Its hard to say there is a way could escape from the mistakes. however, any efforts are worthwhile.

# protect the feelings

feelings are precious.
