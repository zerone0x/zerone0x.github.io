# praface

Music theory which is related to rules of music, maybe the best way to learn it is to analyze it in the music self.

Another things is to know the important parts from music theory.
I'll try to take piano for example and extend to their applications to explain some definitions.

# explain

- pitch 
  - definition: scales and name(A->G)
  - application: distinguish a high/low note
- notation
  - definition: it lies on 5-line staff.

- Octave
  - defi: the distance between two notes with the same name
