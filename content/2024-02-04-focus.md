# Preface
Focus is still a big and important topic caused the time is limited.
I think the key of it is priority and time management.
First, we need to list the tasks and try to break them down.
Second, the expection of execution should be too high.
Third, don't focus for longer, like 1hour, its hard to recover.
Next, watch some nature(Shinrin) photos or exciting videos to recharge.
Finally, maybe we can use focusduration/realduration to measure the focus level.
Anyway, try it.
