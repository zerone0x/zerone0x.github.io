# Preface
Focus is still a big and important topic caused the time is limited.
I think the key of it is priority and time management.
First, we need to list the tasks and try to break them down.
Second, the expection of execution should not be too high.
Third, don't focus for too long, like 1 hour, its hard to recover energy, pomodoro is a good choice.
Next, watch some nature(Shinrin) photos or exciting videos to recharge.
Finally, maybe we can use focusduration/realduration to measure the focus level.
Anyway, try it.
