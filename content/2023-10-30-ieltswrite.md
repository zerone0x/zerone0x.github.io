	 Overall, the total number of visitors increased throughout the given period. Despite the majority staying on land initially, this was surpassed(overtook) by those arriving on cruise liners in the final two years.
	 The total number visiting the island in 2010 was 1 million. This figure witnessed a steady annual rise to reach approximately 2.75 million in 2015. It plateaued at this level in 2016 before experiencing its largest increase between 2016 and 2017, soaring dramatically to its peak of 3.5 million. 
	 In 2010, most resided on the island, with around 3.4 of million remaining on land. This peaked in 2013 at 1.5 million and hovered around that level for the remained of the period. The number opting to visit on cruises fluctuated between a 1/4 and 1/2 a million between 2010 and 2013. In 2014, there was a sharp escalation in cruise visitors; a trend which continued year on year, reaching 1.5 million highest of any category in any year.`
