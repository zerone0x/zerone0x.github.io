<p>其实口语的话题离不开生活，工作，运动，文化，旅行.</p>
<p>part1和part3来说，是需要回答yes/no，再跟上自己的理由/看法，再加点互动更好。</p>
<p>part2，需要在几个问题下，做一个2min左右的小短文，短文的核心是故事，来支撑自己的观点，比如&quot;我去了甘肃，因为那是丝绸之路的必经之路，我对丝绸之路的历史感兴趣，去了很多博物馆，了解了很多知识文化，对我影响很深，这是一个记忆深刻的旅途.&quot; &quot;在小学的时候，我的成绩很差劲，所以周围的人大多都看不起我，但那时候a给了我鼓励，并且帮助我的学习，我得到了很大的进步，他是一个乐于助人，和蔼的朋友&quot; 就要塑造一个原因，一个事件，甚至要描述这个事件的特点，比如地点，时间(long long ago)，人物，事情.</p>
<p>在短时间内塑造一个故事是困难的，如何快速捏造一个故事呢？比如看星空的topic</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>背景</strong>：天空是一个距离我们很遥远的地方，它会令我缓解压力和放松，</li>
<li><strong>地点</strong>: 我选择去乡村的一个山脚下去观看，</li>
<li><strong>事件</strong>: 我第一次在天上看到了很多星星，</li>
<li><strong>感慨</strong>: 那是让人印象深刻的景色，我感觉到人类的渺小，开始思考更加宏大(great,grand)的宇宙,</li>
<li><strong>总结</strong>: 这真的是一个难以忘怀和毫不后悔的经历。</li>
</ul>

<p>There's an individual I deeply admire. He experienced a life-changing accident a year ago, losing his legs. But he didn’t let this setback crush his spirit. He persevered, his determination inspiring me greatly. He once shared that it was through this adversity he found a deeper understanding of life's value.</p>

<p>one month ago, my friend asked me to hike. I didn't like sports, often stay at home, I am not very healthy, I think maybe it could give a try. I went out with him. I felt very tired in the trip. but I insisted to go on. Then I arrived the top of mountain. I started to realize the importance of exercise. And it makes me feel happier. I will exercise every week. I think it's a good way to keep healthy. I started to have a habit of sports. I'm really appreciated that this friend's invitation. it changed a lot for me. I will keep this habit.</p>

<p>About a month ago, a friend of mine proposed a hiking trip. As a person who rarely engaged in sports and was more accustomed to staying indoors, I wasn't exactly in peak physical condition. However, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give it a shot.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The journey was far from easy, and fatigue set in quickly. Despite the exhaustion, I pressed onward. Upon reaching the summit of the mountain, I had an epiphany about the significance of regular exercise. It not only improved my health, but also elicited a sense of joy within me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the aftermath of this experience, I've committed to a weekly exercise routine, which I believe is beneficial for my well-being. This hiking trip awakened a newfound interest in sports, transforming it from an occasional activity into a habitual practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm profoundly grateful to my friend for extending this invitation. It catalyzed a major lifestyle change for me. I'm determined to maintain this healthier routine moving forward.</p>
